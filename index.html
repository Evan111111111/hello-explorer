      <h1>Earth</h1>
      <p>In the distant future, Earth has become a thriving hub of advanced technology and intergalactic diplomacy. Once a planet of simple ecosystems, it now boasts towering megacities that stretch into the clouds, and sprawling artificial biomes where Earth's natural beauty is preserved. The atmosphere, once at risk, has been restored through innovations in planetary engineering. Spaceports orbit the planet, connecting Earth to colonies across the galaxy. Yet, beneath the surface, remnants of ancient civilizations and forgotten technologies lie hidden, waiting to be discovered by explorers who dare to unlock Earth's long-forgotten secrets.</p>
